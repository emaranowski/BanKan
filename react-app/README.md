This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The frontend React application lives here. In the react-app directory, before starting the app, run `npm install` to install all dependencies. To run the app in development, run `npm start`.

No environment variables are needed to run this app in development. For deployment, be sure to set the REACT_APP_BASE_URL environment variable.

NOTE: This React app requires Node v16.20.1.
